            <p>
              You’re probably expecting a sales pitch. Here it is: we’re
              awesome. Keep reading though, because our origin story breaks the
              mold. We didn’t start in Austin or San Francisco with
              head-in-the-clouds founders trying to change the world while
              burning through millions in VC.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We were started to solve a very tangible problem: moving a
              multi-million dollar law firm to
              <a href="https://www.litify.com/">Litify</a>. Their CEO needed
              people he trusted, so he turned to Tyler and Drew.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Unfortunately, at the time, neither of those two guys knew
              anything about Salesforce. Now they do.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              They worked in Drew’s garage until the pandemic kept his kids at
              home all day and his wife needed the house back. So they moved
              their office into a now-empty gym. Between box jumps and bites of
              protein bars, Tyler and Drew started seeing broader market
              opportunities. They brought Seth on board to rewrite his software
              prototype to answer the needs of Litify and their clients.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Things were not pretty. Proprietary software, complex variable
              reporting requirements, and dirty databases—not to mention the
              state of the world—created a network of stressful challenges with
              steep learning curves. The whole situation was banjaxed - Irish
              slang for “broken, incapacitated, confounded or totally ruined.”
              That’s how we got our name, driving I-10 East from College
              Station, TX to Baton Rouge, LA.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It’s been two years and Banjaxed is thriving. We’ve made mistakes,
              but we learn and get better every day. We’ve grown from 3 founders
              to a company of 60. We’ve gone from no Salesforce certifications
              to a slew of them, and we’ve become a certified Salesforce
              partner. With Banjaxed internal tools, our data migrations are
              second to none. Our flagship application, Conversations, gets
              stellar reviews, and has <strong>never</strong> lost a client.
            </p>

              Banjaxed is more than just a business—we're a diverse team of
              innovators, problem-solvers, and trailblazers. We’re a start-up in
              a non-start-up town, and there’s never a dull moment.

              When you surround yourself with people who have grit, a sense of
              humor, and a love of problem-solving, amazing things can happen.
              That's why we hire for aptitude, instead of experience alone. We
              believe in empowering our team members, so we fund training and
              credentialing, and provide other opportunities for professional
              development.

              Taking care of our people is our first priority. That’s why we

                Drew’s life has been a road-trip less traveled. Looking for
                challenges, he left college, went into real estate, then joined
                the Army, and from there went into oil and gas. He didn’t want
                to be away from his wife and kids for long stretches, he taught
                himself to code while working in the field. After creating a
                novel rig sensor data analytics program, he built a custom B2B
                SaaS app called Client Connect. This is where he met the team
                that would later form Banjaxed Solutions. When not leading
                innovative Software-and-a-Service solutions within the
                Salesforce ecosystem, Drew spends time with his family, reads,
                listens to podcasts voraciously, and wakes up early in the
                mornings to exercise and think. He explains, “I come to work
                every day for our employees and clients, the employees of our
                clients, and the clients of our clients. I love that we are a
                force multiplier for the economy, serving individuals in every
                aspect of society”.

                Tyler is a proud Fightin’ Texas Aggie who likes small words and
                lots of zeros. He spent his early professional years in the
                trenches of customer service, product ownership, and service
                automations. After nearly a decade working in the legal support
                space, Tyler took an entrepreneurial leap and tackled this wacky
                ride of start-up life, with some help from a certain law firm in
                Louisiana. He deeply values relationships and has a people-first
                approach both personally and professionally. At Banjaxed, Tyler
                is responsible for business development and building strategic
                partnerships wherever he goes. Tyler is passionate about
                “building crazy things with the people he loves” and wants to
                “create an environment where people are excited to work and grow
                professionally every day by solving problems in ways that serve
                and help others”. You can also find him at his family tailgate
                during every A&M game. He enjoys investing time with his church,
                and pursuing his health goals by putting around the golf course,
                training for half marathons, and working out at the local
                crossfit gym.

                Seth, a serial entrepreneur, has been building businesses since
                2007, and tech solutions since 2011. An intensely driven mad
                scientist of sorts, Seth honed his skills as a custom solution
                architect and business administrator in a deliberate and
                experimental manner. Through a wild series of past endeavors and
                personal connections, he wound up at a table in Baton Rouge
                sitting with a group of guys that would become our founding team
                and initial investors. Seth created Conversations by Banjaxed,
                an omnichannel communications application that makes life easier
                for law firms on Litify. When he’s not hunkered down in his
                laboratory solving problems, Seth enjoys time with his wife and
                children, attending church, reading, watching football
                (primarily the Aggies and the Dallas Cowboys), and sampling high
                quality sushi and green teas whenever he can. Seth’s goal at
                Banjaxed is “to invent solutions that make others’ lives better
                with a family of like-minded people.”

              <p>
                Salil, much to the chagrin of Tyler and the other Aggies at
                Banjaxed, is a Longhorn, by way of New Orleans. He spent his
                formative years working in tech startups in Austin before
                joining the Army. After being shot at and blown up, he has spent
                time consulting with hedge funds, VC, and other startups, which
                is how he wound up in College Station working with us. Outside
                of work, Salil likes to travel, and often visits Austin, San
                Francisco, and New Orleans, where he spends time, well, working.
                He chose Banjaxed because he “wants to work for a company that
                invests in people, and to work with people who want to work for
                a company that invests in people.” It had nothing to do with the
                fact that the investors promised him corporate box seats at the
                Superdome whenever he wanted.
