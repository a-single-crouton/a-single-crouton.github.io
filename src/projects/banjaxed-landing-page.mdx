tools: [HTML, CSS, JS]
description: >
    This landing page redesign was a proof-of-concept for replacing outsorced Wordpress
    freelancers with in-house developers in an effort to ditch Wordpress altogether.
positives:
- I was particularly proud of how accurately the animations matched the originals.
- Our junior developers collaborated well and delegated tasks effectively.
negatives:
- Once the main landing page was completed, our CFO shot down the proposal for the site.
- I regret not finishing the project and the newsletter system; that would have given me
    useful exposure to PHP and server-side features.
notes:
- "note one"
- "note two"
