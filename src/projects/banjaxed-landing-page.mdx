    This landing page redesign was a proof-of-concept for replacing outsorced Wordpress
    freelancers with in-house developers in an effort to ditch Wordpress altogether.
positives:
- I was particularly proud of how accurately the animations matched the originals.
- Since this project was handled entirely by juniors, this led us to gain a lot of *painful* experience managing pull requests and merge conflicts.
negatives:
- Once the main landing page was completed, our CFO shot down the proposal for the site.
- I regret not finishing the project and the newsletter system; that would have given me
    useful exposure to PHP and server-side features.
