description: A HTML Email designed to function as an SMS Notification. The email dynamically populates the last ten messages of a conversation and provides a link at the bottom for the user to safely log into Salesforce where they can respond.
positives:
- I was really proud of the conditional styling for incoming/outgoing messages. It was cool to create conditional classes based on message direction.
-
negatives:
- The project was dictated as 'form over function' so I didn't have the luxury of making this hold up to the quality I think it should've been.
- If there were more time I would've liked to add the message metadata included in the texts (i.e., time of sending etc.)

notes:
- Since this is a static website, it doesn't display the typescript functionality that parsed the messages themselves. This is simply a design recreation borrowed with permission of Banjaxed Solutions.
