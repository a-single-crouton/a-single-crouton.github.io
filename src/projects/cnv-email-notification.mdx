title: "SMS Email Notification"
date: "4/8/2024"
image: ./project-images/email-project.png
tools: ['Typescript', 'HTML', 'CSS']
positives:
- This was one of my first experiences dealing with the constraints of HTML Emails and styling.
- This project helped me learn more about manipulating / parsing data to be properly fed into a frontend design.
- I was proud of how the speech bubbles were styled, dynamically appearing based on whether theyâ€™re incoming or outgoing texts.`
negatives:
- This project was specifically asked to be 'form over function', meaning that there wasn't time for a lot of the fancier bells and whistles I wanted to add.
- I never got to properly embedding photos directly into the email. DOing so would've helped me learn more about transferring more than just markdown and I think it would've been a valuable learning experience.
description: "This project was an SMS Notification System designed to be received over email. Our texting application compiled the last ten text messages which were then separated and sorted into an HTML design to be sent as an email."
notes:
- Since this is a static site, this is a design of what the finished product looked like, not the actual functionality of the project itself.
- This project was done during my time as a fullstack developer and one of the first projects that I worked on without collaboration / supervision.
