tools: ['Typescript', 'HTML', 'CSS']
positives:
- "Sit on the homepage for a minute! Theres a delayed CRT screen effect I built in that is super cool!"
- "The design elements are really personal to me. The borders are an homage to old GBA games and the entire color palette is inspired my a game called Inscryption. This is one of the most creative sites I've ever made and honestly I'm really happy with the feel of it all."
- "Aside from the 'About' section this site is surprisingly responsive. It was my first opportunity to really work with media queries in-depth and I'm happy with the way it turned out. It shows best in the projects page."
- "I love the experimental things I did with this site. For example theres a mask used in the homepage to make a circle cutout, theres a grid of guages to display my level of experience in the about page, and I even designed the return icon myself!"
negatives:
- "The about page was never completed and you can tell it negatively impacts the reading experience."
- "Theres a broken font I never found an alternative for and some of the typefaces couldve used some work. As such the hierarchy of information gets a little muddied at times"
- "This isn't a modern site. Not necessarily a critique but when job hunting its hard to justify as a proof of concept despite how ridiculously cool I think it is."
description: "My personal favorite! This is my original dev portolfio I designed to feel like a retro video game. The site is quick and responsive and, while rough around the edges, is really cool and unique."
notes:
- "Fun Fact: my former coworker designed the sprite of me! That was the original inspiration for the entire site."
