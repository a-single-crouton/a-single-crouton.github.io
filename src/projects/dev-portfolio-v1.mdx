description: This is my original dev portfolio designed using raw HTML, CSS, and JS. 
    Designed as an homage to retro video games while maintaining a clean, readable look.
positives:
- Take a look at the home page! One of the first things I got working is a subtle CRT effect that crawls across the screen (I love it)
- The color palette was sourced from the video game 'Inscription' and modified to only contain key colors.
- I used a lot of techniques I wasn't super familiar with for this site. 
    From the mask on the homepage working as a 'cutout' to the gauges displaying my skill on the about page, I learned a lot working on this.
-  Overall this project is just really close to my heart and I love the way it turned out.
negatives:
- The color palette, while cool, was a little too saturated which made it harder to work with and at times felt overbearing
- The modals ended up with ugly scroll bars to accommodate large paragraphs. I hated the solution but wasn't able to find a solution I liked.
- The header font is broken, causing r's to display a bit funky. I tried fixing it myself or finding a different font download but had no luck.
