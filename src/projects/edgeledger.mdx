tools: ['Typescript', 'HTML', 'CSS']
positives:
- "My first Flexbox project"
negatives:
- "This is just Udemy coursework, so it isn't really an impressive display of skill. If you wanted to know the type of stuff I learned in the beginning, this was it. Otherwise it isn't much."
description: "Coursework done as part of HTML and CSS Learning, used a lot of Flexbox to create a clean, modern interface"
notes:
- "This isn't so much a project as a placeholder. I want to reaplce this with a cleaner rework of the project and figured I'd leave this for now."
