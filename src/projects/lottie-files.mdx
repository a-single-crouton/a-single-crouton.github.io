title: "Motion Graphic Gallery"

description: "Not a project, but a proof-of-concept for building motion graphic microinteractions for our web application."
positives:
- Got familiarity with the Adobe Creative Suite as well as being able to see a designer -> dev workflow through to fruition
negatives:
- I lost access to the company's Adobe Cloud shortly after this project, making adjustments and improvement much more difficult.
- The source icons in our application were all different sizes and as such made editing them in post look a bit funky.
notes:
- This is more of a test than a completed project, but I wanted to add it to prove I'm capable of the full workflow
- If I had the tools or the time, this would likely be a finishing touch on a functional interface.
