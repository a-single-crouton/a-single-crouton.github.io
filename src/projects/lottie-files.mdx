positives:
- "I had never heard of Lottie animation files before this project. The workflow iss uniquely challenging and interesting, and I think it could be used to add a lot of polish to a modern interface."
- "I originally completed this project as a member of the creative team. Coming back to it and implementing them onto a basic webpage as a developer was really exciting and gave me a good idea of how the designer -> developer pipeline should work."
negatives:
- "This project was more of an experiment than a formal project. Once I proved we could make them we moved on to higher business priorities"
- "The timing and sizes of the files didn't properly match the UI. The application originally had a composer menu of different sized icons making these lottie files look jarring next to one another."
- "I lost access to the Adobe Suite by the time I became a developer, making any changes to these files more difficult than its worth."
description: "This is an extremely basic webpage holding looping animations I designed as an example for our "
notes:
- "This project will likely be redesigned in the future. I'd like to add the animations to a click handler as well as make the UI look more realistic, but its not among my immediate priorities currently."
